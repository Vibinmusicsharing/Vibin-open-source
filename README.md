<b>GOAL</b>
<br>
Changing the way music is shared

<b>STORY OF VIBIN</b>
<br>
In this music & social media-dominated industry, we felt that something was missing, something that would allow individuals to participate, feel equal and help them spread their vibe among others. So here we had it Vibin, a platform that would bring people closer based on music or their interest in music.
Our basic motive was to create a platform for people to connect and stay in touch with each other regardless of wherever they are! So, our brainstorming sessions were revolving around how we can make it different from what already is in the market and how we can make it easy for the users so that even if they are living away from each other, they will still have that sense of closeness. .
What is Vibin all about? Let’s reflect on how music has managed to dictate our lives and emotions for so long? How music has managed to create a vibe within ourselves, which has allowed us to rely on it regardless of what we are going through! It has not only helped us to get in touch with our inner self but also allowed us to connect with people all around us
Just think about the last time you were with your friends in a car, exploring the roads, and all of you were connected on the same vibe, how often does that happen now? I bet rarely! The moments created with music have not only made memories for us but have also given us that forever vibe check within our group of friends!
And guys, that is what Vibin is all about, helping you create the vibe, spread the vibe, and most importantly be the vibe!

<b>Problem</b>
<br>
Listening music has been a passive experience and an adventure enjoyed solely since ages. Whole world is connecting in every way possible, be it social media or any other technology. But we always felt the connection made by  music taste is far more deeper than any and we saw a gap in market  and tried to fill  the unfulfilled gap with technology and want some strong connection building  among music lovers. When it comes to music recommendations we are seriously dependent on music recommended by computer or AI or if a friend has to suggest you music
Everyone is stuck on Sharing links, Shazaming, and posting songs on social media. We have many friends who have good recommendations and we listen to great songs everywhere but, how many do we remember?
IT HAS TO CHANGE.

<b>Mission</b>
<br>
To build  a music eco-system to share and discover music and people with similar music taste. 


<b>Solution</b>
<br>
A Playlist-Centric music application which: 


Let’s users add people from around the globe on a playlist and share their music preferences (community building),

Has in-app features that lets multiple users listen to same song at same time and also chat while listening music on the same platform, 


Focuses on boosting the potential of an artist to the correct audience, music groups or labels

Helps music venues demonstrate their theme through music and offers people to vote their favorite music in order to gain customer traction.. 


<b>What is Vibin?</b>
<br>
A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM CENTRED AROUND MUSIC
What music lovers feel about most of the top social networking sites is that they aren't focused on music. This is a big void, since being social helps you engage with other music lovers and discover new songs and artists.

Users will be able to create their profiles and show off music collection and your music taste 

Users will get options to Follow/Subscribe with other users and know about their music taste playlists of any celebrities, colleges and friends created on the app to keep updated with their music feed

<b>THE CONCEPT OF COLLABORATIVE PLAYLISTS</b>
<br>
Mingle in with your companions and create your Fort of music! The collaborators will be able to add more users in order to fortify their music. We haven’t missed any music enthusiast, so a sweet reminder for introverts: The playlist rooms will let you discover and listen to music together, while the rest of the app is for solo consumption! So at the end of the day when you've received some great recommendations from friends, you can revisit them by yourself and enjoy.
Sharing your musical tastes with others is a fun way to discover new music and friends.
The user will be able to create his/her own playlist and make it collaborative in order to team up with mates who can add their favorites up on the list. 
Private playlist (promoting personalized music listening/sharing): Doesn’t show up on your profile. Collaborators are added only through invites.

Public playlist: Shows up on your profile. Anyone can send a collaborate request to the playlist owner.

PING! Notification if any Collaborator make change/update to playlist
Alternatively, a feature will be added in which a specific genre’s public playlist will have one to many admins to monitor it and different users can access and add related songs to it.
QR code and link shareability  of each playlist created by user which can be shared digitally or physically
Description to describe playlist in few words and Tags to classify and define each playlist in its category which can be updated by user at any time.
Another great feature is to like any song in playlist which serve as a voting mechanism on which all the collaborators can vote to move song up and down in playlist to build the ultimate playlist

<b>REAL TIME MUSIC SHARING</b>
<br>
The highlight of our app will be the REAL TIME MUSIC-SHARING feature. The synced playback feature will let you and a friend listen to tracks together in real time. The scenario of young users today has become experiencing each other in real time. 

You could built your ultimate playlist, which would sync in real-time when your friend tunes in. You then listen to it together, as if you were in the same room or sharing earphones.
No restriction on users you can add as many user as you want in your playlist sky is the limit.
